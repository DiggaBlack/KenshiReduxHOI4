 UNC_leader:0 "Emperor Tengu"
 UNC_leader_desc:0 "In a world where food, shelter, security, and freedom are fought and bled for, the smooth-skinned, short-statured scorchlander named Tengu has grown rather bored of them. And why should he feel guilty about it? Anyone, even a fucking peasant, could make it to the noble circle if they really wanted to. That’s what Lady Sanda did, and Lord Haga, and others before them. If his noble bloodline is so bad, why are people practically tripping over each other to kiss his feet on the streets? Why do the samurai continue to exist, serving with unquestioning loyalty to Tengu’s every command? No, it isn’t the nobles’ fault this world is in ruin. Tengu knows what the real problem is: everyone else. The Okranite zealots, those vile bandit gangs- and ESPECIALLY that fucking psychopath down South, Tinfist. They all have no endgame other than his downfall - the Empire’s downfall.\n\nAnd that’s why Lord Tengu doesn’t care if you hate him for his privileges, or his luxurious lifestyle- because frankly, he deserves it. In a world where everyone wants to burn society down, Tengu and his noble circle may well be the only thing keeping it together."
 
 HLN_leader:0 "Holy Lord Phoenix LXII"
 HLN_leader_desc:0 "No man is more powerful, feared, beloved, and despised than the great Holy Lord Phoenix, blessed be his name. Born for the 62nd time into a family of paupers he will never know, raised by the same High Paladins he commanded in his last life, every moment of this reincarnation’s being has been dedicated to the teachings of Okran, and nothing else. A rigorous military education molded the Phoenix into a strong leader and model Okranite. This time, he commands respect from his brothers not with speeches, but with physical prowess and fortitude. This Phoenix’s greatest skill is, undoubtedly, with the blade.\n\nHe is an ambitious conqueror, and a vicious fighter; driven by the blood of Narko’s servants purged by holy iron and flame. With monsters surrounding the Golden Plains on all sides, it seems that Okran could not have chosen a better time to bless the Holy Nation with a monster of their own."
 
 SHK_leader:0 "Esata The Stone Golem"
 SHK_leader_desc:0 "Like every great Shek warrior before her, The Stone Golem's road to glory was paved with the blood of countless Okranite and spider infestations. Unlike all the rest, though, Esata's most important battle was fought against one of her own kind.\n\nAs the Shek Kingdom faltered under Shager's disastrous world war, it was her lifelong friend, Bayan, who first saw the writing on the wall. No one would listen to a puny coward like him. No one, but for Esata. Only she heeded her intellectual ally's warnings of a cratering population and backwards technical advancement. Of all the finest, most brilliant warriors Shek leadership had to offer, only she could see Shager's way - the traditional Shek way - for what it was. Cultural suicide. And so it was. The loyal Esata, the mighty Stone Golem, challenged the brute Shager for the future of their people - and beat him at his own game.\n\nToday, Esata carefully leads the Shek Kingdom into a new age, with the wise Bayan at her side. In many ways, she is nothing like the self-destructive leaders of the past. But, like all Shek legends before her, she hopes to make her kin proud, and win the battle against their mortal foes.\n\nThis time, forever."
 
 
 TDG_leader:0 "Lord Longen"
 TDG_leader_desc:0 "Merchants are the lifeblood of society, and the Trader's Guild is the lifeblood of merchants. Founded about a century ago with the nobility's blessing, today, the Guild provides the Empire with goods all over the world: from shiny gems and luxurious furniture, down to raw resources and the very slaves who work them. The Trader's Guild has grown so powerful, in fact, that it has begun to raise its own army, and fly its own flag.\n\nUnder Longen's rule, however, there is zero risk of this surge in self-sufficiency blossoming into an independence movement. Longen is nothing more than a puppet for the Imperial bloodline, a reality he is content with. Wherever the UC looks to grow, it is certain the Trader's Guild will be right in tow, just as always."
 
 SUC_leader:0 "Lady Miu"
 SUC_leader_desc:0 "Being born a slave often leaves a person without any hope of living a happy life. Being born a noble can be just as damning.\n\nMiu didn't have the guts, nor the wits, required to rule an unruly empire. From a young age, she has always been a pretty pawn in the chess match of more powerful minds. With her ideas always ignored, and her cries for helping peasants swiftly dismissed, Miu fell into a pit of despair she would never emerge from. Living became an excuse to do a copious amount of drugs. Her existence today is the essence of the noble world, a life of unadultered luxury and pure sin. The ruler of the Stormgap Territories in name only, Miu's state operates much like herself - without much regard for the rules they themselves wrote."
 
 SHN_leader:0 "High Inquisitor Seta"
 SHN_leader_desc:0 "High Inquisitor Seta is living proof that even gods can have a creator.\n\nAt just 22 years old, Seta had soared through the Holy Nation's military and religious ranks, earning himself the opportunity of a lifetime - the responsibility of training the young Phoenix into as skillful of a commander as him. From the moment his mentorship first began, Seta has guided the Phoenix with a firm, steady hand. He is the father that the Phoenix never had; perhaps the only man in the entire world who can tell a god what to do, and know that it shall be done. Seta knows he has moulded Okran's golden child into the perfect leader he is today. Not that he'll ever take responsibility for that - not that he ever needs to.\n\nOlder, slower, but still as sharp and charismatic as ever, Seta officially manages a smaller army holding Narko's fogmen at bay. But in reality, as it has always been, the Phoenix and Okran's children march down the dark tunnel that is this world - with Seta as their guiding light."
 
 IHN_leader:0 "High Inquisitor Vindictus"
 IHN_leader_desc:0 "Eight decades of unwavering, relentless faith to the blessed diety Okran has taught Vindicus one thing: there is far, far too much of Narko's degeneracy in this world.\n\nIf only, he laments, all people could simply accept Okran into their heart; so much destruction and suffering could be forever avoided. But Vindictus has long outgrown this naivety now. Some people are too tainted by Narko's beasts, too impure of heart, to listen to the good word of god willingly. And so it must be done by force. What kind of force? Vindictus has come to appreciate Okran's many forms of punishment. Reeducation for those that once spoke ill of Okran or his people, those who could still find salvation in this life. Rebirth for the beasts and witches of the world, who must wait until the next life for a chance at redemption. And for the worst heretics of all - their only remaining contribution is to become fuel in the ever-burning Holy flame.\n\nThe decrepit, dying general oversees it all, from his tower in Camp Rebirth. Narko's ever-growing list of traitors, spies, and demons, are condemned to serve the one true god in Vindictus' pure, perfect little fiefdom."
 
 VHN_leader:0 "High Inquisitor Valtena"
 VHN_leader_desc:0 "Piety, Charity, Brotherhood. In Okranite teaching, these are the holy traits that all men should strive to be. Valtena, in truth, cares for none of them. His mission is glory.\n\nSurely Okran, in all his might and righteousness, would destroy Narko and the evils of this world once and for all if he could. He has not. This leaves only one possibility: the two forces of good and evil are, in fact, equals, incapable of overpowering the other. The struggle between their kind will last forever. This may be a horrific revelation to some, but to Valtena, it is a calling. Men are not meant to live forever. What greater achievement could a man earn than falling in battle for the cause he believed in?\n\nValtena has no tolerance for traitors, and those who cower from the glory of battle. If his forces are needed in yet another war, be it in Bast or the UC, they will answer the call, and slash their way into the Golden Plains beyond."
 
 HHN_leader:0 "High Inquisitor Harbinger"
 HHN_leader_desc:0 "When Holy Priests taught the young Harbinger about the horrors of Skeleton culture, he listened. When he was drafted into the army to fight the decadent nobility in Bast, he followed. And when he was given a hopeless order to hold the city from hordes of Samurai invaders, he fought with infallible bravery. It cost him his arm, and nearly his life, but he was honored for his sacrifice. He was proud.\n\nNow, he isn't so sure.\n\nAs an officer, Harbinger has taken a step back from the battlefield to see the inner workings of his beloved country. He sees sadistic treatment of slaves they are supposedly saving. He anguishes as Fiona, the woman he truly loves with all his heart, is treated more like cattle than a person. He is ordered to take up arms against the White Legion, an army of Hivers and Sheks fighting back against the persecution his people have committed. He is supposedly in charge of this bloody campaign, but really, he can only watch.\n\nHe cannot watch for much longer."
 
 SSK_leader:0 "Mukai The Mountain"
 SSK_leader_desc:0 "The Mountain has often been criticized as being a warlord. This would be inaccurate, as he does not see himself as a leader - rather, the best soldier a Shek warrior can be. All his life, he has clawed his way to the top, gaining the highest honor as the Shek Army's top general. Whoever rules - Shager or Esata - makes no difference to him, as long as the way of the warrior is given its proper respect. And this is what worries him.\n\nThe recent prominence of weak, eggheaded fools, such as Esata's cowardly assistant Bayan, set a dark precedent for the future of the Kingdom. Through all the infighting of the past few turbulent years, Mukai has stayed vigilantly by Esata's side, putting trust in the Kingdom that raised him. But should Esata do the unthinkable, and shift Shek culture away from its roots - perhaps he will have to preserve this legacy himself."

 BOB_leader:0 "Tora The Gutless"
 BOB_leader_desc:0 "The Band of Bones is a bandit gang exclusively comprised of 'dishonored' Shek warriors, who lost their horns and were shunned by Shek society. Chief among them is arguably the most famous Shek ever to lose their horns: Tora, the youngest (and shortest-tenured) warrior ever to become a Hundred Guardian. Her retreat from a hopeless battle cost her honor in the kingdom, but martyred her to another group. A large portion of the young Shek population, with no confidence in their decrepit government, has rallied behind Tora's fiery defiance. They want to show Esata who the true warriors are. They want nothing more than to burn Admag, and everything the corrupt warrior caste of the Shek Kingdom holds dear, to the ground."
 
 BRS_leader:0 "Ghost"
 BRS_leader_desc:0 "Ghost and the Berserkers are, even by Shek standards, a particularly violent tribe. They are tribalistic and anarchic in nature, fundamentally disagreeing with the concepts of industry or civil society. They believe in nothing but war and the honor of falling in battle alongside one's comrades. They are so committed to this ideology, that many of their ranks have cut off their horns on purpose, to give them better movement and more accessible headgear."
 
 FSS_leader:0 "Tanuki"
 FSS_leader_desc:0 "The Free Shek State was a quiet rebellion of the Shek servant class, led by a young, brilliant mind named Tanuki. Even a 'battle-hardened' race like the Shek has plenty of citizens who want nothing to do with war, instead pursuing intellectual or agricultural endeavors. These castaways had high hopes for Esata turning the country's way of thinking around. But, after she reaffirmed the kingdom's centuries-old commitment to the warrior tradition, they have finally had enough. They have risen up in the weaker Southern provinces with the goal of negotiation, but the means of resistance, if it must be so."
 
 BLB_leader:0 "Kuma"
 BLB_leader_desc:0 "The Bugmaster's rise to power a few decades ago caused the Shek Kingdom to completely lose hold of their Southern territories, in a shameful defeat that became known as the Great Retreat. Old habits die hard, though, and for no one is this more true than a Shek warrior. Thousands of soldiers on the Bug front refused to abandon their post, even if the Kingdom itself would no longer support them. Surviving all along in an extremely hostile environment, these soldiers have all but lost their minds, even resorting to ritual sacrifice cannibalism."
 
 STC_leader:0 "Haggerdy"
 STC_leader_desc:0 "Ever since the Tech Hunters were first founded, they have made efforts to explore places no one else dared to go. Of course, it wasn't long before they set their sights on The Crater, despite its extremely dangerous wildlife and unforgiving climate. What Haggerdy found in the ancient labs of this long forgotten land were weapons of biological destruction so terrible, that even the Tech Hunters were scared of them. The Chapter has since gone rogue, refusing to return to their old employers with the horrors they uncovered. Instead, they stand their ground; keeping guard of this technology no one else must ever come to possess. They can trust only themselves to never use these horrific weapons.\n\nUnless they have to."
 
 DSP_leader:0 "Fall"
 DSP_leader_desc:0 "The Desolate Plunderers brand themselves as a more 'open' version of the Tech Hunters: why become an intellectual answering to cushy Machinists when you can forge your own adventures? This advertising has gained them pretty sizeable following from disgruntled, bored citizens of the UC. What the Plunderers really are, though, is a bandit gang like any other, preying on the weak and occassionally selling the shiny things they find for money."
 
 FOL_leader:0 "Raven"
 FOL_leader_desc:0 "Being born blind is all but a death sentence in a world as harsh as that of Kenshi. Raven, however, didn't need the two eyes on her face. For she has a third, all-seeing eye - a remarkable gift that gained her fame and adoration around the UC years ago. Her uncanny ability to predict the future, unsurprisingly, made her an excellent decision maker. The nobles grew at odds with Raven after she predicted the imminent downfall of the Empire, however, her following was too large to make her disappear. She and her followers began the long march into Shun, a forgotten corner of the world, to build a society that would soon become the future. The Forsaken League is a free society built on common good, human rights, and equality for all. Many laugh at this state as a utopic vision which could never survive. Raven, however, isn't doing this for them.\n\nSomeday, many years from now, the world will understand."
 
 UFF_leader:0 "Head of Genetics"
 UFF_leader_desc:0 "As the Second Empire slowly disintegrated into a shell of itself, so too did its research institutions. They were once the pride of a growing society, reaching new milestones in all sorts of fields, working towards the betterment of society and its people. Except for one.\n\nFrom the grey, deadened plateau of Crystale, creations of unspeakable cruelty are tested and perfected, through the blood of unlucky captured souls. The Unit tries and tries to modify their subjects into a superweapon that can turn Cat-Lon's war around; a weapon which will never come. They all end up as nothing more than forgotten statistics. Except for one.\n\nThe Bugmaster was their finest creation. And now, decades after massacring his containment facility in the Western Crater, The Bugmaster is their greatest enemy. The soldiers of Lab 45, the last of its kind in a world long past Cat-Lon, now must fight the hell that they have wrought upon this doomed world."
 
 ARG_leader:0 "Captain Foster"
 ARG_leader_desc:0 "How does an aging scorchlander with a bum leg lead an army of convicts, fortune seekers, and battle-hardened Shek kamikazes? Superior planning? Absolute authority? Evidently not, as Foster is neither a genius nor a despot. On the grim front lines, Foster can be seen cracking witty jokes to his men, passing out Grog cans. He treats even the lowest level grunts with the same respect he shows to his own family. In the world of military officers, Captain Foster is one of one, and the only man the Arach Guard has ever wanted or needed.\n\nFrom its inception, the Arach Guard has had one of the most dreadful jobs in the world: keeping a madman and his army of bloodsucking spiders at bay. It's not a job most want to do, one that at times feels hopeless and thankless. But it is a necessary evil, requiring warriors of the highest bravery and grit. For the good of their loved ones back home, and the whole world with all its flaws, someone has to do this. For 30 years, it has been their sacred duty. And through it all, Foster has been the man at the front; the beloved leader who backs up his charm with remarkable mastery of the blade.\n\nRealizing his inevitable expiration may not be far off, Foster eyes the Bugmaster's recent gains with steadfast determination. He will win. His boys will win. Humanity will win.\n\nThe Bugmaster will die. Or he will die trying."
 
 BUG_leader:0 "The Bugmaster"
 BUG_leader_desc:0 "The Bugmaster is less of a man than a cataclysmic, unrestrainable force of nature. Its early days were the hardest. Gleaming white lights. Strange machinery, prodding and prying at every piece. And the machine men who operated them, the foul creatures that spoke in mysterious tongues. The experiment suffered through it all, getting stronger, deadlier with each abuse, plotting its revenge.\n\nThen, the day finally came. The spiders, long shared in his misery, could speak to him. More importantly, they listened. The Bugmaster, as it is unknowingly called, gained its title by slaughtering its captors, turning its former prison into its a palace built from the bones of his prey. But the children still hungered for blood. One complex, one crater, one peninsula was not enough. Never enough. They needed more, more, more.\n\nIt understands. Like a storm, or a deadly disease, the spider horde grows and grows. It knows the last of its tormentors lies in a land far east. And it will consume anything in its path to get there."
 
 
 
 
 SRR_leader:0 "Brown"
 SRR_leader_desc:0 "It was a revolt from the outside that the nobles prepared against for decades. That's why they were caught so off guard when the revolt eventually came, of all places, from in their own ranks.\n\nBrown was a man born into wealth, who quickly proved himself to be unlike his peers. A charismatic fellow and a capable statesman, many bought into the stories he sold them about disappearing slaves and growing militias. But even the best-laid ruse can only be kept a secret for so long. With the Nobles' unforgivable, cowardly decision to support the Manhunter faction, Brown, and all those wronged by this miserable institution, have taken up arms with every intent to fight to the death. They have already seized the Western cities, and plan to keep bravely marching on. They cannot afford to bide time any longer. They will keep marching on, not stopping until every slave is free, and every hungry peasant can finally get a piece of the pie."
 
 XUC_leader:0 "Lady Merin"
 XUC_leader_desc:0 "Even in the noble circle, where leaders have all the time in the world to better themselves, education is laughed at and dismissed as something for Tech Hunters to struggle with. Lady Merin is different. She spends countless hours reading texts, both ancient and modern, about the so-called 'First Empire' - the civilization that came even before Cat-Lon. The story she learns is utterly fascinating.\n\nA world where all people lived in luxury and prosperity. A world where machines could do anything and everything - even allowing people to fly above the clouds, into the stars. As the noblewoman looks from her balcony upon the sad city of Drifter's Last, her eyes drift towards the sky. She dreams of a better future - no, a return to the glory they once had. Of course it is possible. But it cannot come without sacrifice.\n\nLady Merin does not view institutions like slavery with the same rosy optimism as her peers. But she recognizes it as a necessary evil. Her personal misgivings are nothing when the future of society, of everyone that will ever be, is at stake.\n\nThis is not a time to play nice. This Empire is better than that."

 MNH_leader_desc:0 "'Private, in this world, there are wolves, and there are sheep. What do you want to be?'\n\nDe Lux came to learn that there was, in fact, a third option. Being the vulture that gets a free meal.\n\nThe Hive soldier was exiled from his Western birthright at just 13 years old, an achievement practically unheard of before or since. It began a long life of being an unruly, uncoachable misfit. In spite of his prowess in combat, De Lux was kicked out of the Samurai Army, Mercenary Guild, a Tech Hunter Expedition, and even the desperate Central Territories Guard for persistent disobedience. Eventually, he finally reached the bottom of the barrel, finding the Manhunters' Guild. Here, he truly found his calling. The Manhunters didn't restrain themselves like other organizations pretending to stand for something. They were real soldiers, through and through. They got plenty of victories, they got plenty of women, they took what they wanted, and they made a shit load of money doing it. Now, with the Manhunters' entire existence being threatened by recent changes in the Southern policy, De Lux has risen to prominence in the organization as a natural counter-reaction. If the nobles continue down their foolish path of self-destruction, they'd better watch their back: For you can never, ever trust a hungry vulture."
 
 FCC_leader:0 "Lord Shiro"
 FCC_leader_desc:0 "In the aging mind of the soft-spoken Shiro, doubts and misgivings run wild. He looks back on his own legacy - indeed, the entire nobility's legacy - and he sees failure. A thoroughly broken institution existing only for the short-term, sacrificing its people for the longevity of the regime. Can this institution last? Many years from now, when the time comes for historians to judge him and his nation, will anyone remember them? With the way things are going, would such a date even be that far off?\n\nCatun, the shining jewel atop a mountain in the valley, has always been a beacon of progressive idology in the Empire. As Shiro moves through the streets and bars, stalked by his royal guards, he hears whispers of a word once unthinkable - 'democracy'. Shiro has been careful to act dismissive of the notion around members of his caste. But deep down, he is troubled by it. He wonders how much time he has left before a referendum is held on himself, his people, and the everlasting legacy of this beautiful city. Most of all, he wonders if he will have the courage to take the necessary step - or if he will end up as one of many failed rulers before him, crushed in the collapse of his own arrogance."
 
 RSB_leader:0 "Bellamy"
 RSB_leader_desc:0 "An outsider would never guess that the Red Sabres, a roving gang of backwater thugs, had some of the oldest history on the entire continent. Their cosplay of a seafaring era from long ago is anything but incidental. For centuries, they have pillaged and plundered as a way of life, being a nuissance for whatever great power ruled the region. The tradition is so old that their ancestors, unbeknownst to Bellamy and his clan, first robbed from Cat-Lon and the Second Empire. Then it was the Okranites, the Empire, and lastly, the Free Swampers' Union.\n\nMost groups, Bellamy realizes, work towards unending goals and naive notions of improvement. These pirates, on the other hand, will be a pain in the ass for all of them. And they wouldn't have it any other way."
 
 SWN_leader:0 "Shade"
 SWN_leader_desc:0 "Even the worst monsters among men still feel fear. Such is the case for Shade, one of the most reviled names on the planet. He first founded the Swamp Ninjas without any particular goal in mind, other than a common banner for his bloodthirsty clansmen to unite under. But the situation isn't so simple any more.\n\nIn the few short years of the Swamp Ninjas' existence, they have skyrocketed in size, beating out even the Red Sabres to be the biggest gang in the Swamplands. The capture of Marshall from the Empire a few months ago serves as a testament to their rising power. Of course, this growth has come at a cost. The Swamp Ninjas became infamous for butchering everything in their path, even the innocent with no hope of fighting back. This isn't the warrior's code, and Shade knows it. He cannot stop the clan's madness, for fear of them turning on him next. He is guilty without any hope of redemption, constantly in fear of his abominable creation. Soon expecting a fitting end to his violent regime, he is a paranoid man with his back against the wall - and those men are the most dangerous of all."

They've gained a small support base from Swampers hidden in the Pauper mountains, seeking to fight back against the Swamp culture of debauchery and drug addiction. Their true goal, however, is much darker. The Holy Nation's rulers see nothing in the Swamp worth saving. It is Eden's mission to purge this tumor on the world of everything that moves."

He simply has the wrong approach: the Anti-slavers operate out in the open, painting a giant target on their back and villainizing themselves to the brainwashed population. The Grayflayers have a better idea. The Grayflayers, a tight-knit clan of thieves and assassins practically unknown to the wider world, will bring the nobles to ruin without ever leaving the shadows.

Their activities, from organ harvesting to hit jobs, have attracted all kinds of sketchy buyers around the world. They are a thriving gang content with their place in the shadowy underworld. There is, however, always some room for expansion. With the recent crisis in Shark, the Twinblades are more than ready to pounce."

It was in this lab that the Cold Bloods were born.\n\nThese half-raptor, half-man creatures faced scorn and disgust from society for their appearance and lifestyle; particularly from the first generation of Okranite settlers. They were hunted nearly into extinction, pushed back to the far fringes of Swamplands. But now, with the chaos of the Swamp Anarchy, they have emerged from the ashes to reclaim their homeland.\n\nTheir last attempt at cooperation with humans was marred by blood and tears. This time, there will be none."

Sage has had an incredible life, and with his 57-year rule, his homeland has grown from a backwater dump to a bold, free state.\n\nBut Sage, now the unfathomable age of 92, can feel it all slipping away. In his increasingly rare moments of clarity, he sees the gangs - once his friends - bicker amongst themselves, escalating problems over nothing. Once upon a time, he could step in and defuse the situation, bringing everyone together for the greater good. Now they simply dismiss him, tell him there is nothing to worry about like a mother calming their scared child. He fears for the future of his people, and the union he gave everything he had to build. And then, he is out of it again, existing happily in a world far away from this one.\n\nNo one has said the quiet part out loud, even though everyone but Sage understands it. Sage was a good man. Too good to know the hell the Swamp is about to fall into."

This monarchy, however, is anything but conventional.\n\nThe Queen does not come from a royal bloodline, nor even another member of her own species. In truth, the Queen is a machine, the fourth and final trial of an ancient experiment that failed spectacularly twice before. Her decisions are made not with care or concern, but with cold, calculated efficiency. All the hundreds of thousands of Hivers produced from her vats are not the hive. SHE is the Hive. And the Hive must survive. Every order she gives is to preserve her own interests, and nothing else.\n\nAt the very least, this queen is not as destructive, expansionist, or as dead as her counterparts. She has done a good enough job raising her children into model citizens, inside the Hive or outside of it. Make no mistake, though. The lives of her subjects mean very little to her. After all - she can always make more."

They'd never be able to replace their old Queen, certainly not with the Queen of the West, who had misgivings about accepting them as refugees in the first place.

Instead, it was Sirni who earned the honors.\n\nHe certainly possesses the intellectual talent to lead a nation. Sirni earned his respect by coordinating most of the evacuation effort from Old Yarma, saving thousands of Hiver lives. But his heart simply isn't built for the thankless job of being in charge. Every life lost to the fog hordes eats further away at his conscience, every tough decision causes another sleepless night. With the Fog Horde's growing numbers, and the Holy Nation coming back for more, Sirni will have to find courage within him to do what it takes to save his people - what's left of them."

 ZBD_leader_desc:0 "Misery loves company. Dimak and Buzan, the 'marriage from hell', are as madly in love as they are mad.\n\nThese two got their start as Empire highwaymen during the first World War, robbing poorly defended caravans far from the front in Stormgap Coast. In short order, they'd assembled a bandit army of Imperial traitors and 'freed' slaves. They earned their name for their swift and ruthless ambush tactics - sneaky like ninjas, deadly like dragons.\n\nBut when the World War came to a close, the UC could finally commit the full wrath of its army to hunting them down. The wanted couple fled with whoever they could on a brutal trek through Venge and the Deadlands. What remains now is a gang of battle-hardened, vicious warriors that terrorize the helpless Border Zone. The gang and its dynamic duo, unwaveringly anarchic and unapologetically themselves, have been through it all together. Their love for each other is strong. But their lust for blood is stronger."

 ZWE_leader_desc:0 "The first World War, in all its horror, tested the faith of each and every Holy Nation citizen. It's no surprise that many Okranites, particularly wounded soldiers, gave up their beliefs in favor of their own sanity and survival. Such was the origin story of the White Eyebrow Clan.\n\nThis independent group of ex-Okranite veterans looks for no higher power, answering to no one but a man named Vicker. He is a quiet, orderly man, still stuck in the rigid ways of being a Holy Nation officer. His obsession over small details, and the 'moral' restrictions he places on his soldiers, would drive most other bandits up a wall. Yet, for the former soldiers of White Eyebrow, he is the perfect man for the job.\n\nOn some level, no soldier can ever truly leave the army. They will always need order, missions, and purpose. Vicker gives that to them. It is, in many ways, all they really have."

I'm sorry that this is how you had to find out, but I don't think there was any other way.\n\nThe truth is that the Phoenix isn't my hero, and he never will be. My hero is Dad. I'm sure you remember all the times I used to visit him in the hospital when he was busy working. Well, I wasn't always just watching and praying with him. I was his assistant. In the time we shared, he taught me almost everything he knew about medicine. He taught me how to treat all sorts of injuries, even with the terrible equipment we had. It was very illegal, and we both knew you would have hated it. But he did it anyway because he was a great man who genuinely cared about saving people's lives. And I've always known that I wanted to follow in his footsteps.\n\nMom, I hope you realize that the Phoenix killed Dad because he wanted technology that could save lives, and because he saw you as an equal. He wasn't a heretic or a skeleton sympathizer. He was a great man and a great doctor who just wanted to do his job. I can't live any longer in a society, or a household, that treats its own people with so much hate and ignorance. So, I'm leaving for the Border Zone, to pick up where Dad left off. Those people clearly need help more than the ones here do.\n\nI'm sorry it had to end like this, but I am fully confident in my decision. Please don't come looking for me. You won't find me.\n\nI love you.\n\n-Ava"
 
 ZBH_leader:0 "Slingin' Sami"
 ZBH_leader_desc:0 "World War One traumatized the entire Border Zone, but no group had it worse than human women. They faced persecution both from the ruthless Sheks and the Okranite zealots. Many died, many fled to the Empire. The few who stayed, weathering years of a daily struggle for survival, were left with deep scars and empty souls. All they had left was a burning desire for revenge.\n\nSami was among the women cursed with this fate. Formerly an Elite Sniper in the Samurai Guard, she used her unique skillset to terrorize both sides indiscriminately in the war. By the end of it, she had racked up over 700 total kills, not regretting a single one. In doing so, 'Slingin' Sami' became a mythical figure amongst her peers, and word of her even spread to women trapped in the Holy Nation. Well before Moll became the idol for female defiance, there was Sami, in all her brutality.\n\nSince the Border Zone's partition and resulting collapse into anarchy, Sami has formed the Bleeding Hearts Gang for other women broken by war. The Shek, thankfully, have a new face in charge; but the Holy Nation is still full of the same old bastards. Word has reached Sami of another woman up North, leading a rebellion of her own against Okranite pigs. Perhaps, if she can turn the gang from a sorry bandit group into a fully fledged army, they have a fighting chance together...\n\nHoly Men have been responsible for unimaginable pain and suffering to women. It's time these girls return the favor."

If these are men of God, and they are indeed enacting his divine will upon us, what reason do we have to love that God? Do you believe that HE has any love for US?\n\nNo! Okran is a false god! I will have no god of mine who hates me for who I am!\n\nThere is, however, another god in this world. A god - nay, a demon - who understands our pain. Her name is Narko. Since the beginning of our creation, she has fought Okran at every turn. I have seen for myself the fear in the eyes of Paladins when they lay eyes upon us, the spawns of Narko. I have not once felt happy engaging in the lifestyle that Okran demands from us. I cannot force myself to be subservient to man, I cannot bring myself to hate people with horns or machine parts. In fact, my brothers and sisters, I have come to learn that what I truly hate is human men, and every thing that answers to the wretched, vile god of Okran. With Narko as our witness, my brothers and sisters, we will defy every law, destroy every person that Okran holds so dear! We shall answer to false gods no longer!

But in recent years, these bandits have gained a true identity under a powerful leader, the Dust King. Through cunning and military might, he has united hundreds of raider groups under one flag. He's even managed to drastically reduce the influence of greater empires in the region.\n\nThere's a beauty in the simplicity of the Dust Bandit's operation. They don't discriminate on background, intelligence, skill, or morals. Anyone can be a Dust Bandit, as long as they follow orders and like breaking things. This wave of popular, aimless destruction now has its sight set on greater things - namely, the entire Border Zone and beyond."

As evidenced by the recent wave of rebellions sweeping the Shek Kingdom, most who lose their horns simply turn against their own, feeling betrayal and heartbreak from former kin. But there are some who haven't forgotten, still crying for the acknowledgement of their homeland.\n\nRuka is a Shek patriot with every fiber of her being, but after surviving a hopeless battle in the first World War, the love she feels for her country was never returned. She'll have to win it back in the only way she knows how. Ruka enters the Border Zone with nothing but the clothes on her skin, the sword on her back, and thousands of others who can only say the same. They will do what the Shek Kingdom could not, and conquer the Border Zone under the purple flag. Once their victory is won, these forgotten souls can finally be remembered. They will  return home, at last, as heroes.\n\nRight?"

As lesser groups fight amongst themselves over petty squabbles and swelled egoes, the Hives move relentlessly forward towards progress. It is the most effective, most righteous, most perfect system this world has to offer. Who says you must be born into it?\n\nThe Halfway Hive, as it is called, is not named so just for its location. It is the only nation in the world of its kind, a nation built on Hiver ideals with an ordinary man as its queen. Desperate people across the Border Zone, particularly Hive exiles, have flocked to the nation for its promises of utopia. They never found it, but they have at least gained a purpose in Farse's strange hybrid Hive. That is all many of them need."

As luck would have it, the war's ceasefire and resulting abandonment of the Border Zone left the Hub with just what they wanted. They were on their own, for better and worse.\n\nProblems quickly ailed the dysfunctional state, namely, a lack of direction and the emergence of widespread banditry. All the Border Zone was slowly lost to anarchy. The Hub, too, would have fallen, had it not been for the incredible efforts of a man named Hitori. Despite having no education or military training, his achievements since assuming leadership have been impressive. He has pushed the Dust Bandits all the way past the other side of the river, and secured a stable economic future for the time being. Daunting sacrifices have been made, but Hitori and every Hub Citizen knows the alternative. For their everlasting freedom from tyranny, there is no price too steep for them to pay."

His true legacy, however, comes in the form of the Bonedogs which now infest the region. His war animals of brutality and torture, long abandoned by their masters, have grown into an enormous wild population that may never be reversed.\n\nOnly the most fanatical Okranite soldiers remained in his 'army', now unapologetically a bandit group like any other. Their homeland may now despise them, but that doesn't change their mission, their holy purpose.\n\nThey came to purge this dark land of Narko's influence.

A hiver trying to topple their queen.\n\nStickton's recent history is characterized by radical change. The city has always been a safe haven for West Hive exiles, but not until now have they adopted such loathing towards their origins. It would seem that the wave of rebellious action sweeping the world has hit some Hivers hard. It's not their Hive brothers that the liberationists of Stickton are after - it's their self-serving, uncaring queen at the top of it. They dream of a Vain where all the hivers can carry on their peaceful lives with the freedom they deserve.\n\nAll people yearn for independence, even the ones brainwashed by years of authoritarianism.

But it was not so for the dastardly duo. With their physical talents, sharp thinking, and more luck than they'd like to admit, they've made a name for themselves as a ruthlessly efficient hunting machine.\n\nLike everything in their lives, their moral values change with the highest bidder. Which is always the Empire. Threka, Reka, and an army of several thousand mercenaries arrive to the Border Zone not looking to bring about change in the region, but to dismantle everyone else trying to do so, allowing the Empire to swoop in and clean up the mess.

It would greatly expand Free Swamper influence, both economically and geographically. It was a perfect plan. Then he got old and stupid, and a big war happened that ruined the region forever.\n\nThis hasn't stopped Midori, the most stubborn man in the Swamp, from trying to salvage the situation. He has appointed himself as governor of Greenleaf, not only to exclude himself from the Swamp's own downward spiral, but to revive an investment he doesn't see as dead just yet. With an arguably worse army of bloodthirsty tyrants at his gates, Midori has his work cut out for him. But should he succeed, and turn the Border Zone into the massive farm his hero always envisioned, he will be rolling in coins - and finally making his uncle proud."

Then they tried to control her, and were met with unwavering resilience every time. Now they’ve resorted to the much simpler method of just trying to kill her. Instead, one failed assassination after another has turned Moll into, perhaps, one of the most feared faces on the planet.\n\nNo doubt, resistance has its cost - Moll tries not to think about what those bastards did to her poor mother, and all the friends she’s lost to Rebirth or worse. But she can’t just give up. Never. Through and through, Moll has the heart of a rebel. Her fiery optimism, outstanding bravery, and faith in Okran - the REAL Okran - has helped her build the Flotsam Ninjas into the well-organized uprising they are today.\n\nAnd one day, Moll hopes, it will help her in freeing her sisters from the madness of the Phoenix’s unholy regime."
